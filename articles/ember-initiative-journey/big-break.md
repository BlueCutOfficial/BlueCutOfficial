# The Ember Initiative Journey üêπ‚ù§Ô∏è

In mid-July, after week 17, I had to stop the Ember Initiative because I was needed on a different project at Mainmatter. It was a bit sad for me to stop when we were so close to releasing Vite support for the inspector. But this is how it is, and now I am back on the Ember Initiative! üéâ

## Unlocking Ember Future with the Ember Initiative

Even though I was working on a different project, I continued to prepare the talk I presented with Chris Manson at EmberFest Brussels. It was about modern Ember, the recommended path to update to modern tooling, and of course, the Ember Initiative itself. We explained what it is, why the community needs it, and introduced a brand new plan that should make it easier for smaller companies to join the initiative. (I'll link the recording of the talk here whenever it's available.)

## While I was away...

My colleague Florian replaced me on the Ember Initiative. He developed improvements on ember-vite-codemod and on the ember-inspector. Also, the Vite support for the Ember Inspector is now released üéâ Chris continued the pairing sessions with the Initiative members, which allowed us to track meaningful issues to solve as part of the Initiative. Also, Ember 6.8 is coming and Vite will now be the default experience when using `ember new`, as promised in the EmberFest talk.

## Now that I am back

I already have a few things at the top of my to-do list. Our latest blog post must be finalized, we need to figure out a problem that is occurring between template-tag-codemod and ember-cli-sass, and I am also going to challenge a bit the public roadmap we used to share ongoing topics.

_I am really happy to be back on the Ember Initiative, and I can't wait to do many useful things for the community._
