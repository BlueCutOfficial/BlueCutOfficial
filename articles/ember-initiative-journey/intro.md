# The Ember Initiative Journey üêπ‚ù§Ô∏è

_My journey as a developer working on the Ember Initiative._

Web technologies move fast. Do you imagine using a 13-year-old JS framework in production? It is possible, and it is actually a good choice when it comes to using the amazing irreplaceable [Ember JS](https://emberjs.com/). Ember is _that old_, yet it's still around because it's the most _alive_ framework of all. It grows up with you; it evolves with you; it becomes a better framework year after year as you become a better developer.

As a developer at [Mainmatter](https://mainmatter.com/), I have the privilege of working on the [Ember Initiative](https://mainmatter.com/ember-initiative/) and contributing to the framework life. Our current focus is the brand-new build system. Soon enough, when you will create a new Ember app with `ember new`, it will generate an empty app building with [Vite](https://vite.dev/). And we don't want to stop there; there are so many ideas to implement to improve the whole Ember ecosystem more and more.

I want to bring you on my journey working on the Ember framework and share with you what I am learning week after week.
