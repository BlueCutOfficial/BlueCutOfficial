# The Ember Initiative Journey üêπ‚ù§Ô∏è

_Week 8 - a new release for ember-test-selectors_

_#web #emberjs #embertestselectors_

[ember-test-selectors 7.1.0](https://github.com/mainmatter/ember-test-selectors/releases/tag/v7.1.0-ember-test-selectors) is out, along with **strip-test-selectors 1.0.0**. After this topic was closed, I could also look into some issues on ember-vite-codemod and pair with Chris on our big next step: getting Ember Inspector work with Vite.

## Tips from ember-test-selectors

### About `workspace:*`

ember-test-selectors is now a monorepo with the following structure:

- ember-test-selectors: the classic addon that used to exit before
- strip-test-selectors: the transform functions you can configure in your Babel config directly when your app uses Embroider+Vite
- tests:
  - classic-app: tests the compatibility of the classic addon
  - node-tests: unit tests for the plugin that strip `data-test-*` from JS objects
  - vite-app: tests the configuration for strip-test-selectors 

Working with monorepos requires familiarity with the concept of [workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces). To simplify the idea, it's a protocol that allows you to declare what are the different packages contained in your monorepo.

If you have already looked into a v2 addon monorepo relying on pnpm, you may have seen the syntax `"my-v2-addon": "workspace:*"` in the `package.json` of the test app. This syntax means "please use the local version of `my-v2-addon`, whatever it is", so you don't need to manage a manual version update inside a monorepo. 

What you may not be aware of, though, is that this concept is something pnpm calls [workspace aliases](https://pnpm.io/workspaces#referencing-workspace-packages-through-aliases), and there is something very important to know about it: the workspace aliases are interpreted and replaced during the `pnpm publish`. It means that as long as you use `pnpm publish` to publish your public packages, you can safely use `workspace:*` inside a public package that depends on another package of the monorepo (e.g. ember-test-selectors [has a dependency](https://github.com/mainmatter/ember-test-selectors/blob/master/ember-test-selectors/package.json#L18) on strip-test-selectors).

### Using Babel in a Vite app

The new documentation for strip-test-selectors explains how to configure Babel in your Embroider+Vite app to reproduce the behavior of the classic addon. If you have an Embroider+Vite app, you necessarily have an existing `babel.config.cjs` file already. This is a requirement because any fresh empty Embroider+Vite app relies on Babel plugins out of the box, this is part of the app blueprint.

Have you ever wondered how the `babel.config.cjs` ends up being used, though? If you generate a simple Vite app using `pnpm create vite`, it won't use Babel out of the box; you need a way to tell Vite that Babel has to be executed at some point. The answers lie in `vite.config.mjs`:

```js
// other imports...
import { babel } from '@rollup/plugin-babel';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    // other plugins...
    babel({ babelHelpers: 'runtime', extensions }),
  ],
});
```

The plugin `babel` from [`@rollup/plugin-babel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-babel) is the piece that considers the Babel configuration file. Vite plugins are based on Rollup's plugin interface with a few extra Vite-specific options. Therefore, Rollup plugins are compatible with Vite and can be used as is in Vite's configuration. This is the reason why if you write a Vite plugin that uses only features inherited from Rollup, then [the convention is to name it a Rollup plugin](https://vite.dev/guide/api-plugin.html#conventions).
