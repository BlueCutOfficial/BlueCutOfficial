# The Ember Initiative Journey üêπ‚ù§Ô∏è

_Week 9 - a plan for Ember Inspector_

_#web #emberjs #docs_writing_

This week was a lonely week for me since both my coworkers and my manager were on vacation. I had to move forward with all the topics we had on the table, and I focused on three of them: improving ember-vite-codemod, preparing the communication about the Ember addons audit, and working on Ember Inspector.

## First things first: rewrite the README

Like every senior developer, I was a junior once. My most traumatising memories from this period relate to a particular part of error solving: guessing what other developers mean when they write stuff on the Internet. At some point, it seemed to me that they were unclear _on purpose_, I was suspecting some unconscious ego issue, like "If I add more detailed explanations about something, it means I think it's not obvious. But if other developers think that I think it's not obvious, but it's obvious to them, then they will think I am incompetent". Something like that. I was desperately seeking a logical answer to the questions: "Why are all your docs so BAD? Why don't you want to EXPLAIN? You've written a lot of stuff here, but what's the CONCLUSION? What do you MEAN? What's the matter with YOU?".

Almost a decade later, I am no longer that mad at the entire dev community. The main reason is that I learned enough things to understand way more often what they try to say, and I can generally follow the docs from A to Z üéâ But I still struggle sometimes. Now, even on docs that look globally pretty good to me, each time I don't understand a line right away, each time I have to experiment a bit to reach the "ah, ok, that's what they mean"... I have an emotional thought for the junior me who would have just thrown her computer through the window and given up everything to go breed a herd of goats in the Ard√®che hills. And I rewrite the docs.

You only have good reasons to rewrite the docs:

- It's the easiest type of open source contribution. You just change a markdown file, it's 100% safe, you're not going to break the world.
- If you didn't understand something immediately, there are certainly other developers who won't understand it at all. Your feedback has value, and if someone answers you, "Pff, but that's obvious," then this person is the problem; you're not the problem.
- If you don't like helping other people that much (it's fine), then help yourself. The next person reading this document after you could be you, eight months later, without any recall of what was it you struggled with.
