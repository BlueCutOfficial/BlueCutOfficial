# The Ember Initiative Journey üêπ‚ù§Ô∏è

_Week 15 - Reworking the plan_

_#web #emberjs #ember_inspector #rfc #embroider_compat #thought #taking_breaks_

The main event of the week is that the RFC we wrote for Ember Inspector won't be accepted as is. The compatibility part of it is roughly ok, but what the Ember Inspector should be in the future should be redesigned more drastically. In other words, we designed a solution based on how to reuse existing pieces, but the Core Team is unhappy with the existing pieces in the first place.

## Adjusting the strategy

Getting the RFC rejected is not necessarily bad news. It doesn't change our work really: We still need to bring Vite support to Ember apps from 3.28 to latest, which don't and never will have the new API that allows Ember to expose ESM module to the Inspector. So we have a compatibility piece to implement, and this piece is time sensitive since developers who moved to Vite are already stuck with a non-functional inspector.

The only part of the plan that changes for us is the post-RFC part: We wanted to get the RFC accepted, then implement it. Instead, we will rework the RFC and leave it in a state that explains the direction to take in the future, but we won't do the implementation. It doesn't enter the current budget, and the priority is lower than the compatibility piece anyway.

The RFC has been moved back to draft, and the current content already redefines the problem: https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/1119

This week, I started the implementation of the support script in `@embroider/compat.inspector-support`. It's a TypeScript package that compiles files based on a config. However, it doesn't work well with the static script we want to provide. Interestingly, a working solution was to make the script an `mts` that compiles to `mjs` so we have the ESM shape in output. I am afraid this is the only tech tip I have to share this week. Now, the rest of the work is to get a new prototype working with this script to finalize the PR with proper testing instructions. This doesn't go as smoothly as I was hoping for, but I am confident I will reach that goal soon enough.

## The importance of breathing

I tire myself out when I realize how unproductive I can become when dwelling on something I am unhappy with. The root cause is one everyone probably knows as well as I do: the lack of focus, which quickly combines with the stress of noticing how fast the time passes while you're stuck on your problem. Lack of focus sometimes pushes me in the wrong direction by different means. One in particular is very annoying: misreading or unconsciously ignoring error messages.

It's like an old mental trace from when you were a beginner. Beginners tend to misread or even unconsciously ignore error messages. That's a problem I used to have in the past. The project doesn't work. It doesn't work. It means I can't finish my job. I'll be late. How much late? Can I even do it? Will I do extra hours? But I am already exhausted! I don't know what to do about it. The panic state in the background prevented me from paying attention to details, because really, I didn't want to read that horrible red thing, I just wanted to complete my task.

Experience and time teach that errors are friends. Most of the time, when you read them very carefully and pause to consider what the message means, it points you out the right direction. Cooperating with the error is just harder for some people when they are tired or stressed out. My personal advice: just close your computer and take a break, breathe, do a yoga session or whatever helps you to calm down. When you reopen your computer, go back where it all started, and read slowly and carefully everything the console tells you.

You might discover that you just copied and pasted a `return` statement in a template string that is not supposed to contain one üôÑ

_I am now following 3 paths in the Ember Initiative journey: the "compat" inspector support for Vite, rethinking the perfect API for the RFC, and preparing the EmberFest that will happen in September. I hope to get the first one done next week. I feel that I am pretty close and that breathing enough could do the job._
